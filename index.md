> This project is an Open Source industrial 3D camera. The goal at current stage is to create a low cost 3D camera with capability of current generation industrial cameras. It is also a computer with GPU computing capability, in which can run 3D point cloud recognition algorithms and robotic arm control programs. This camera can be used in scenarios such as bin-picking, assembly, 3D inspection and many others. 
> 
> Our ultimate goal is to continuously reduce the cost of industrial 3D cameras with the help of deeplearning's capabilities of abstract representation, and allow machine vision and AI to penetrate all aspects of this carbon-based world.

> 这是一个开源的3D工业相机项目。我们现阶段的目标是打造一款低成本的通用3D工业相机，性能达到市面上的工业相机水平。同时它也是一台具有GPU运算能力的电脑，可以运行3D点云识别的算法和机械臂控制程序。这款相机可以用在散乱拣取、智能装配和3D缺陷检测等诸多场景中。
> 我们的终极目标是借助深度学习对世界的抽象能力的使3D相机的成本不断降低，最终使机器视觉和AI渗透到这个碳基世界的方方面面。
